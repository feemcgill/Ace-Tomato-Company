# Square Community - Words Are No Constellation

A visual album of sorts for my buddy Johnny Gutenberger's music project.. dusty analog ambient tape-loop stuff. Most of the photography is Johnny's. He pulled together images and public domain video clips that work with each song.

Coding wise we came up with a few different interactive "vibes" which were configured in different ways for each song.
